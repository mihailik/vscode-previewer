# TTY: Terminal in WASM for VSCode

Building an extension to run Linux-like **bash** terminal in VSCode/Web and full VSCode
virtualised inside WASM environment.

The goal is to expose the virtual VSCode filesystem to the shell, and gradually add more tools.

Python would be possible with pyodide.

Node.js might be cool too.
